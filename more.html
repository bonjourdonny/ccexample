        What kind of favourite musicals list is it if there isn't Hamilton in it? As the name suggests,
        the musical tells the story of the founding father Alexander Hamilton. Also, Lin-Manuel is a lyrical genius.

        Top tier soundtrack!!! It tells the story of an ancient Greek myth of Orpheus, who goes to the Underworld, to bring back his lover,  Eurydice. 
        I had goosebumps watching their Tony Awards performance and listening to the soundtrack!!

        I'm sure I don't have to explain what the musical is about. But they have some of the most inspiring and insanely talented 
        cast. I was awe-struck from just their random in-public performances and flash mobs and rehearsals, let alone the actual show.

        A musical comedy centred around Monty Navaroo, the ninth in line to inherit a dukedom, who goes on to try and eliminate the eight standing in his way.
        I always had a love for musicals, but their Tony Awards performance made me love them even more - the acting, vocals, choreo, blocking and the TIMING were so impressive.
